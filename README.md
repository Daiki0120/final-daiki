I spent over 50 hours for the final project, but feel little progress on that. I can't even run javascript on html in both way, using .js and writing on html directly.
I don't know why I failed to use "npm start" function to test .js file. I read class materials throughly...
I'm sorry, but this is what I can do for the final.

Also, I added homework due of which was several weeks ago. If it is OK, please evaluate it and give score for that.

Thanks you for your class.

P.S.  I successfully finished recruiting at Mckinsey! It was tough decision not going to your class though,....
